# ChitChatRomeo
chatting app using socket.io and node

I used node.js, socket.io, express and html to build this realtime chat application.

socket.io creates a persistant connection between client and server so that client don't need to again and again 
send the request to the server to check for updates.

How to use?
step 1: clone this repo
step 2: type "nodemon index" on console
step 3: open two tabs on browser any give url:http://localhost:4000/
